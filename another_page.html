            Studying webdvelopment is an interesting experience. It can be easy like swimming on a shallow pool, and
            sometimes things can just flow well.
            Other times you might get stuck, and it feels like swimming around to nowhere. But, with enough
            perserverence, like a diver swimming up, a solution will be found
            and everything can suddenly click.
            And much like surfing or diving, it requires practice and experience, and to a certain level, enjoyment of
            the process.
